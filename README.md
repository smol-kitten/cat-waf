## Quick Start

### Option 1: Pre-Built Images (Fastest - 2 minutes)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smol-kitten/cat-waf
cd cat-waf
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prebuilt.yml up -d
```
üìñ **See [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) for detailed instructions**

### Option 2: Build Locally (5-10 minutes)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smol-kitten/cat-waf
cd cat-waf

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Set DASHBOARD_API_KEY, DB_PASSWORD, ACME_EMAIL

# Start all services
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Dashboard Access**: http://localhost:8080  
**First login**: Use `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` from `.env` file
